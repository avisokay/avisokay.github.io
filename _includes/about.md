My passion for cooking has existed for nearly as long as my passion for eating. Sourdough bread making in particular has become a cherished weekly routine of mine.
<br>
<br>
Between sharing meals with family and friends, I also love to spend my time running and playing board games. 
<br>

In the future I hope to continue to improve at rock climbing, break four minutes in the mile and see how fast I can run a marathon!
